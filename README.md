## TODOs:

### Reinforcement Learning
- Work out how we can teach models to play on the market
- visualisations

### Impact Data
- Data gathering from a specified source
- Preprocessing
- Tokenization

### Impact Prediction
- Matching impact data with coin data -> finding correlations
- Trying to predict if a certain piece of news will have impact

### Backtesting
- Add backtesting functionality so that a strategy can be tested across all of available data to see how good it is
- Allow backtesting to work on certain pre-identified periods (like bear market/bull market)
- visualisations

### Price/Trend predictions
- fix LSTMLinear outputting NaNs
- create a portfolio of models
- better visualisation


### SAAS
- creating a frontend to interact with the various services
- hosting a server that runs and processes data in real time
- user data to customise their strategies etc.
